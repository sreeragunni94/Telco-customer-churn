# Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecom Company

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is **WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv**, which contains various features related to customer demographics, account details, and service usage.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following key columns:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents**: Demographic features.
- **Tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges**: Account-related features.
- **Contract, PaymentMethod, InternetService**: Service-related features.
- **Churn**: Target variable (Yes/No), indicating whether the customer churned.

## Project Structure
The Jupyter Notebook follows these main steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Reads the dataset using `pandas`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes distributions and relationships using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature scaling.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
   - Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Results & Interpretation**: Analyzing key insights from the model and feature importance.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/customer-churn.git
   cd customer-churn
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecom Company.ipynb"
   ```
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to follow the analysis and modeling steps.
